Overview
========

This module provides a software library that allows multiple uarts to share 8 bit ports for a multiple UART communication. It is dynamically re-configurable for applications that require a level of flexibility during operation.

Features
--------

MultiUART component provides the following functionality. All options are dynamically reconfigurable via the API.

      - Notes
    * - Baud Rate
      - 150 to 115200 bps
      - Dependent on clocking (see :ref:`sec_ext_clk`)
    * - Parity
      - None, Mark, Space, Odd, Even

      - 1 to 30 bits
      - Max 30 bits assumes 1 stop bit and no parity.
